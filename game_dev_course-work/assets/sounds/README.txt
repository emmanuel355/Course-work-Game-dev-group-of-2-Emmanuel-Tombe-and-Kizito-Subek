Place your custom sound files in this folder with the following filenames (or update the game code to use different names):

- brick_hit.wav       (played when a brick is destroyed)
- paddle_hit.wav      (played when the ball hits the paddle)
- life_lost.wav       (played when the ball falls and a life is lost)
- level_complete.wav  (played when a level is completed)
- menu_select.wav     (played when selecting menu buttons)
- bgm.mp3             (optional background music loop)

Recommended formats: WAV for short SFX, MP3/OGG for background music.
Keep files reasonably small to avoid long load times.
